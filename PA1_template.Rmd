###This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals throughout the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

###Dataset: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

####The variables included in this dataset are:

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

###1. Load and Pre-Process the Data

```{r}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
URL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(URL, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "auto")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

```{r}
data()
```

```{r}
activitydf <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```
```{r}
head(activitydf)
```
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
#For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.
###2A. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
stepsA <-aggregate(steps ~ date, activitydf, FUN=sum)
```

###2B. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(stepsA$steps, col="blue", 
                     xlab = "Steps", 
                     ylab = "Frequency",
                     main = "Steps Taken Daily")
```
###2C. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
meanA <- mean(stepsA$steps)
```
```{r}
medianA <- median(stepsA$steps)
```
```{r}
medianA
meanA
```

##MEDIAN = 10765  MEAN= 10766.19

#3. What is the average daily activity pattern?

###3A. Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
interval5 <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activitydf, FUN=sum)
```

```{r}
plot(interval5$interval, interval5$steps, 
                        type = "l", 
                        lwd = 4, 
                        xlab="Interval",
                        ylab="Avg. Steps Daily", 
                        main="Average Daily Steps \n (5-Min)")
```
###3B. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
filter(interval5, steps==max(steps))
```

#4. Imputing missing values

###4A. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs)

```{r}
sum(is.na(activitydf$steps))
```
##There are 2304 rows with NA values.

###4B. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
agg <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activitydf, FUN=mean)
mergeagg <- merge(x=activitydf, y=agg, by="interval")
mergeagg$steps <- ifelse(is.na(mergeagg$steps.x),mergeagg$steps.y,mergeagg$steps.x)
head(mergeagg)
```

###4C. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
mergeagg <- select(mergeagg, steps, date, interval)
head(mergeagg)
```

###4D. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
intervalmerge <- aggregate(steps ~ date, mergeagg, FUN=sum)
```

```{r}
hist(intervalmerge$steps, col="blue", 
                     xlab = "Steps", 
                     ylab = "Frequency",
	                   ylim = c(0,40),
                     main = "Daily Steps (With Imputed Values)")
```

```{r}
meanB <- mean(intervalmerge$steps)
```
```{r}
medianB <- median(intervalmerge$steps)
```
```{r}
medianB
meanB
```

##NEW MEDIAN = 10766.19 NEW MEAN= 10766.19
##ANSWER: Both the MEAN and NEW MEAN are equal in value (10766.19). There is a 
1.19 Difference between the NEW MEDIAN and MEDIAN (10766.19-10765=1.19)

#5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

###5A. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
install.packages("chron")
library(chron)
```

```{r}
mergeagg$dayofweek <- ifelse(is.weekend(mergeagg$date),"Weekend", " Weekday")
table(mergeagg$dayofweek)
```
```{r}
mergeagg
```

###5B. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
newmagg <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dayofweek, mergeagg, FUN=mean)
```

```{r}
ggplot(newmagg, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + geom_line(color="red", size=1) +
                  facet_wrap(~dayofweek, nrow=2) + labs(x="Interval", y="Number of Steps")
```
